An implementation of a simple Raytracer.

# Where to try it easily ?

There is a simple demo that can be found in the releases section:
https://github.com/MuellerMarvin/RayTracer-in-CSharp/releases/tag/0.0.1

# How to compile ?

The repo consists of a VS2019 Solution that runs best with .NET 5 installed.
Just open it and given you have selected .NET 5 in the installer it should compile by itself.

# What can it do ?

It can render simple spheres with a diffuse shader.

# Will there be more modes ?

Yes. I'll be working on reflective surfaces and an implementation of materials as well as rendering of polygon-based models, not just simple spheres.
